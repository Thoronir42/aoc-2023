# Go go AOC!

Welcome to the repositoory of my AOC solutions. Here I try to learn [Go lang](https://go.dev)
as I face various challenges posed by the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com).

## Prominent features

In order to keep it organized, a basic framework is provided to avoid code repetition. Some of those features are:
- ‚å®Ô∏è CLI exposing with each task implemented task solutiono
- üì¶ ENV configurable system for various aspects, please refer to the `.env.sample` file
- üë• Multi-user directory structure

## Usage

In order to run the project:
1. `go install`
1. `go run . <DD=00> <part=1|2>` - replace \<parameters\> by desired task
